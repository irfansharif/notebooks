    $ git clone git@github.com:irfansharif/notebooks.git
    $ docker build -t irfansharif/notebooks notebooks
    $ docker run -it \
        -p 8888:8888 \
        --mount type=bind,source="$PWD"/notebooks/src,target=/notebooks \
        irfansharif/notebooks

Alternatively use 'run-container' for a handy wrapper around the command above.

NB: The base image is just that, a base image. It doesn't contain the
experiments themselves but packages in the set of dependencies (via anaconda3)
and build environment needed to run various Jupyter notebooks. It is publicly
available at hub.docker.com/r/irfansharif/notebooks/, and can be used to have a
Jupyter server operate off a locally "mounted" directory. $SRCDIR, locally, is
where the Jupyter server will transparently read and write from.

Usage:

    $ docker run -it \
        -p 8888:8888 \
        --mount type=bind,source="$SRCDIR",target=/notebooks \
        irfansharif/notebooks

Eventually this will be repackaged into a separate base and src images with the
notebooks present out of the box.
